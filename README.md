# Personal Academic Website Starter

A minimal, single-page academic website (pure HTML/CSS/JS) inspired by common faculty pages.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repo named `your-username.github.io`.
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repo root.
3. Commit and push. After ~1 minute, your site will be live at https://your-username.github.io/

### Customize
- Edit `index.html` with your name, bio, links, and content.
- Replace `assets/img/profile.jpg` with your headshot (keep the filename or update the `src`).
- Add more sections or pages as needed. The CSS is intentionally simple.

### Optional: Custom domain
- Buy a domain (e.g., Namecheap).
- In your repo, add a `CNAME` file containing only your domain (e.g., `amirhossein.dev`).
- Point your DNS to GitHub Pages (A records + ALIAS/CNAME per GitHub docs).

### Optional: Use a theme (Jekyll/Hugo)
- Instead of this starter, you can fork a theme (e.g., `al-folio` for Jekyll or `Wowchemy` for Hugo) for auto-publications and blog features.
